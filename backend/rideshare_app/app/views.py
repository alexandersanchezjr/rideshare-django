users can participate in trips in one of two ways â€“ they either drive the 
cars or they ride in them. A rider initiates the trip with a request, which 
is broadcast to all available drivers. A driver starts a trip by accepting the 
request. At this point, the driver heads to the pick-up address. The rider is instantly 
alerted that a driver has started the trip and other drivers are notified that the trip 
is no longer up for grabs.
